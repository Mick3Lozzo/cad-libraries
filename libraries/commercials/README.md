### Ball bearings
Each family table groups ball bearings of a different type.
- `ACBB` - Angular Contact Ball Bearings
- `DGBB` - Deep Groove Ball Bearings
- `NRBG` - Needle roller bearing
- `TBBG` - Thrust ball bearings
- `NRTB` - Needle roller thrust bearings
- `SABB` - Self-aligning ball bearings

Furthermore the bearings are grouped depending of the sealing. As an example:
- `CUSCI_DGBB1` = no sealing ( they're an open bearing)
- `CUSCI_DGBB2` = seal on one side (they're shielded on one side)
- `CUSCI_DGBB3` = double shielded (they're shielded on both sides)
- `CUSCI_DGBB5` = double shielded low friction ( they're non-contact seals)
- `CUSCI_DGBB6` = double sealed ( they're sealed on both side)
